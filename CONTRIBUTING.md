## 🪶 Contribution Rules

- Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) (enforced via Ruff).  
- Keep the **core library dependency-free** — dev tooling lives only in `pyproject.toml`'s `dev` group.  
- Run `poetry run poe check` before committing.  
- Open PRs against the **`main`** branch.  
- Be kind: small tools should have small egos.

**Thank you for helping keep Apathetic Schema minimal, dependency-light, and delightful.**
